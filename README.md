# BYTES-Book-Your-Tickets-Extremely-Superfast-

When was the last time you tried to book a Tatkal ticket but failed to do so owing to its high demand? Well, no worries BYTES is there to help you out. It's a Python script that lets you book tatkal tickets within a minute. Selenium is used here for scraping and form-filling. 


Now let's come to the good part. In order to speedily book your tickets, all you gotta do is input all the data like source, destination, date of journey, passenger details, etc. The user input part is the most important part of the script. If you fill up the data in perfect accordance with the steps given below, your ticket will be booked for sure. And please make sure that all the input is entered within inverted commas. 


These are the following fields you'll have to enter as user input in the script. The order given here is the same as the order in the script.

1. **username** : Your IRCTC username
2. **password** : Your IRCTC password (Your login credentials remain safe. You can have the script proofread from someone who knows                       Python and Selenium.)
3. **source** : Source station code (No need to enter the exact station code. For eg., if you are departing from Delhi, then DEE, DLI,                   NDLS, NZM, ANVT, etc., any of the station codes will work. The script will auto-accept the alert box if we have a                       differing station code.)
4. **destination** : Destination station code (Both source and destination to be entered in uppercase only.)
5. **DOJ** : Date of Journey (Strictly to be entered as dd-mm-yyyy.)
6. **train_no** : Travelling train number. For eg. 12952 is the train number for New Delhi - Mumbai Rajdhani Express.
7. **travelling_class** : Your travelling class. (**1A** = AC First Class, **2A** = AC 2 - Tier, **3A** = AC Three Tier, **FC** = First                           Class, **CC** = AC Chair Car, **SL** = Sleeper, **2S** = Second Sitting. For eg. if you are going via chair                             car, enter **CC** in this field.)
8. **boarding_station** : The station where you will board the train. Leave it blank if your source station and boarding station are the                           same.
9. **quota** : Your booking quota. (**GN** = General, **PT** = Premium Tatkal, **HP** = Physically handicapped, **LD** = Ladies, **TQ**                = Tatkal, **SS** = Senior Citizen. For eg. if you are booking in Tatkal quota, enter **TQ** in this field.)

Now comes the passenger details. For a general quota ticket, maximum of 6 adults and 2 children can be booked on a single PNR. While for a tatkal ticket, the figures are 4 adults and 2 children. The details of each passenger consist of 7 records. They are mentioned below in the same order as the script.

1. **passenger** : Name of the passenger. To be entered in uppercase.
2. **age** : Age of the passenger.
3. **gender** : Gender of the passenger. (**M** = Male, **F** = Female, **T** = Transgender. For eg. if the passenger is female, enter                   **F** in this field.)
4. **berth** : Berth preference (**LB** = Lower berth, **MB** = Middle berth, **UB** = Upper berth, **SL** = Side Lower, **SU** = Side                  Upper, **WS** = Window Side. For eg., if you want the upper berth, enter **UB** in this field). This field is not                        mandatory and can be skipped. Please note that WS is to be entered only for CC and 2S class.
5. **meal** : Meal preference (**V** = Veg, **N** = Non Veg, **D** = No Food. For eg., if you wish to eat non-veg, enter **N** in this                 field). To be entered only for Shatabdi, Rajdhani, Duronto or any such trains where food is served. Do note that this                   field is mandatory if food is served in your train. Else, you can leave it blank.
6. **concession_preference** : To be availed only if you are a senior citizen. For females, the age limit is 58 years and for males it                                  is 60 years. (**1** = Avail full concession, **2** = Forgo 50% concession, **3** = Forgo full concession.                                For eg., if you wish to avail the full concession (why wouldn't you :P), enter **1** in this field.)
7. **bed_roll** : Available only in Garib Rath trains and Duronto sleeper class at a charge of â‚¹25 per passenger. If you wish to avail                     this service, enter **Y** in this field, else leave it blank.

**IMPORTANT** <br />
Leave the credentials of the other passengers blank in case you are less than 6 people travelling. For eg, if you are 3 people travelling on general quota, fill up the credentials from passenger 1 to passenger 3 and keep the remaining credentials (4-6) blank.
Also in tatkal quota, the credentials of only the first 4 passengers (1-4) will be taken into account. <br /><br />

Now comes the child passenger details. At most 2 children can be booked on a single ticket. Three details exist for each child. These are mentioned in the same order as the script.
1. **child_passenger** : Name of the child. To be entered in uppercase.
2. **child_age** : Age of the child. (**0** = Below one year, **1** = One year, **2** = Two years, **3** = Three years, **4** = Four                        years. For eg., if the child is below one year, enter **0** in this field.)
3. **child_gender** : Gender of the child. (**M** = Male, **F** = Female. For eg., if the child is male, enter **M** in this field.)

Now we have the miscellaneous options. Filling these fields is not mandatory, though you can always choose. For all these options, enter **Y** if you wish to select it, else enter **N**. Again, these are mentioned in the same order as in the script. For the uninitiated, I'm talking about this secton. <br /><br />
